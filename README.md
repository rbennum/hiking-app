# Hiking App
This project is a part of [SwiftUI tutorial](https://udemy.com/course/swiftui-declarative-interfaces-for-any-apple-device) conducted by [Mohammad Azam](https://github.com/azamsharp). Check out more for his lectures!

## Changes
There are several things I have added outside what the guide showed me, such as:
- Extending the creation of both navigation title and navigation bar title to support the methods only available in iOS 14+
- Creating empty placeholder modifier to supports list content when being empty (thanks to this [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68513590)!)
- The MIT license (okay I'm just stretching it out this time)
